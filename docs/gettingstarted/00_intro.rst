The CREDO project aims to create reproducible environments. It is currently
developed in `Calogero Lab <https://www.calogerolab.it>`_ as part of the
Reproducible Bioinformatics Project.

One of CREDO's main goal is to build environments that can be shared across
researchers.

At the current state, CREDO offers support for four package managers: pip, apt,
cran, and conda.
It also supports git, as a means to `clone` other projects.

The smallest unit of configuration data in CREDO is called a spell.

A spell entry contains all the data necessary to install a specific dependency.

An example configuration file is as follows::

    # !!! WARNING !!!
    # This file is automatically generated by CREDO.
    # CREDO is a tool designed to create reproducible environments.
    ---
    pip:
        - name: numpy
    conda:
        - name: scipy
          external_dependencies:
            apt:
                - name: foo-bar-devel

Each section of the file contains one (or more) spell items, that are then
propagated to their modules.

To generate this file, you can use the credo command line.
