The CREDO project aims to create reproducible environments. It is currently
developed in `Calogero Lab <https://www.calogerolab.it>`_ as part of the
Reproducible Bioinformatics Project.

One of CREDO's main goal is to build environments that can be shared across
researchers.

At the current state, CREDO offers support for three package managers: pip and
apt.
It also supports git, as a means to `clone` other projects.

The smallest unit of configuration data in CREDO is called a spell.

A spell entry contains all the data necessary to install a specific dependency.
