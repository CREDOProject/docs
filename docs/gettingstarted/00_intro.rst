The CREDO project aims to create reproducible environments. It is currently
developed in `Calogero Lab <https://www.calogerolab.it>`_ as part of the
Reproducible Bioinformatics Project.

One of CREDO's main goal is to build environments that can be shared across
researchers.

At the current state, CREDO offers support for two package managers: pip and
apt.
It also supports git, as a means to `clone` other projects.
